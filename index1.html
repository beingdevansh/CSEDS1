        <p>In 1995, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury creates the Avengers Initiative, envisioning it as a group of heroes working to respond to planetary threats, following the appearance of Carol Danvers and naming it after her U.S. Air Force callsign, "Avenger".Years later, Fury assesses various individuals for it, including Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.Stark's membership is declined after a negative report by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Natasha Romanoff.The World Security Council wanted Emil Blonsky to join, but rejected it after Stark deters Thaddeus Ross from the idea, hiring Bruce Banner instead.
